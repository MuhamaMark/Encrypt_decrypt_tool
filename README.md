As I was in my high school, I got so much engulfed in watching hacking movies, SYFY movies and most of them (Hacking movies) could end up loosing info to enemies and partners. So I started noticing that everything of ours should be encrypted to avoid any unwanted attention or to get privacy for messages that we send or read.

The purpose of this project is to help encrypt a text / message for security reasons. In case one has to send and email, there have to type the text in the tool and insert password then encrypt is, after the encrypted message is sent as email/message and the receiver has to insert the password to decrypt the text/ message.
The team is a one-man team, I worked on this project alone, I was responsible for research, design and development of the tool.

Installation:

The tool is have been made and executable file by using pyinstaller and can run on windows os platforms.

Usage:

The user first enters the message or text and password. Then select encode or decode from the options. It is to be noted, the same key or passphrase should be used for encrypting need to be used for decrypting.

The tool is used for testing is known as security token / authentication token for checking the encryption capabilities.

Related Projects:

secretPad - It encrypts the text using a password, it is a simple and plain text encryption software. The interface is simple and looks Windows Notepad. Storing personal records can be stored using it. To set the password, you can set it from File menu or just have to press Ctrl+W. Encrypted files will be saved in CDT format. 
The difference is that secretPad is just for files on the desktop, it's like a folder lock. You can't transfer the info to another machine to decrypt it, but mine and secretpad both hide info/ text.
