# Project Name: Encrypt_decrypt_tool

Introduction:

As I was in my high school, I got so much engulfed in watching hacking movies, SYFY movies and most of them (Hacking movies) could end up loosing info to enemies and partners. So I started noticing that everything of ours should be encrypted to avoid any unwanted attention or to get privacy for messages that we send or read.

The purpose of this project is to help encrypt a text / message for security reasons. In case one has to send and email, there have to type the text in the tool and insert password then encrypt is, after the encrypted message is sent as email/message and the receiver has to insert the password to decrypt the text/ message.
The team is a one-man team, I worked on this project alone, I was responsible for research, design and development of the tool.


This a python created tool for encrypting and decrypting text messages
